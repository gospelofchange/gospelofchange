- 👋 Hi, I’m @JeremyAndTheGospelOfChange
- 👀 I’m interested in building a bridge between Liberating Structures Community and web3. My hypothesis is that DAO's need Liberating Structures and Liberating Structures need a DAO.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Token Engineering, Commoning/Regenerative Economics and memesis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning to use Liberating Structures! Join one of the practice spaces I host https://www.meetup.com/changehackers/
- 📫 How to reach me ... gospelofchange or jeremy&thegospelofchange most everywhere.
